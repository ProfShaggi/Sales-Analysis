# Excel Data Analysis Project: Sales Analysis and Order Management.

### Project Summary
This project was initiated to help a retail business address core operational concerns through data-driven insights. The client posed the following key business questions:

- Which products generate the highest revenue and profit? What are their associated costs?
- What are the trends in revenue, cost, and profit over time?
- How do order statuses (Completed vs. Returned) evolve, and what patterns can be identified?
To address these, I developed a fully automated, dynamic Excel dashboard that integrates data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 
The tool empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize operations independently.
